## Project Description

Deforestation is a critical environmental issue, and it is essential to monitor and detect deforestation activities for conservation efforts. This project focuses on building a deforestation detection system that leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze satellite imagery and detect deforestation activities.

Key features of the project include:
- Satellite imagery data collection and processing.
- Machine learning model development for deforestation detection.
- A web-based frontend using Flask to interact with the model and visualize the results.
- Integration of the machine learning model with the Flask web application.
